# Path of Exile Trade Hotkey Omnibox

## Structure
This README assumes some basic knowledge of the terminology around Chrome
extensions.

It uses a React app in the content script (built using
[react-content-script](https://github.com/yosevu/react-content-script)). If you
would like to better understand the structure of the app, then looking at the
bare boilerplate for that repository would be helpful.

There is no popup or background at the time of writing.

## Sources
This repository is build off combining two boilerplates:
* [chrome-extension-typescript-starter](https://github.com/chibat/chrome-extension-typescript-starter)
* [react-content-script](https://github.com/yosevu/react-content-script)
